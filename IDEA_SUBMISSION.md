## What is TakeOne?

TakeOne is an AI-powered search tool designed to make video editing faster and easier. Editors often remember how a moment felt in a scene but waste hours searching through raw footage to find it. TakeOne will solve this by letting editors search clips using natural language, just like how they think.

Instead of basic keywords, users will be able to type descriptions such as "a hesitant reaction before answering," and TakeOne will find the most relevant clips. It will do this by breaking videos into small segments, understanding visual content using AI models, and matching it with the user's intent. It will also support dialogue search through automatic transcription and allow filtering clips by emotions like tense, happy, or calm.

The idea is simple: reduce time spent searching footage and help editors focus more on creativity rather than manual work.

## The Problem

Anyone who has worked with raw video footage knows how painful finding the right clip can be. You remember the moment. The look on someone's face, the pause before they spoke, the tension in the room. But you have no idea where it is in the timeline.

Traditional methods don't help much. Filenames are usually meaningless. Manual tagging takes forever and still misses half the moments you might need later. Basic search tools can find "person" or "office" but not "someone looking uncomfortable."

Editors end up scrubbing through hours of footage just to find a few seconds. It's time-consuming, frustrating, and takes them away from the actual creative work of putting a story together.

## How TakeOne Will Work

When you upload a video to TakeOne, it will automatically split the footage into short clips, about two seconds each. For each clip, the system will generate a visual understanding using AI, which can describe what's happening in a frame without needing any labels or tags.

When you search, you just type what you're looking for in plain language. The system will expand your query into related visual concepts and find clips that match. So if you search for "hesitant reaction," it will know to look for things like looking away, pausing, and uncertain expressions, without you having to spell all that out.

There will also be audio search. The system will transcribe everything that's spoken, so you can search for specific dialogue. If you remember someone said "I didn't mean it," you will be able to find that exact moment.

And if you want to filter by mood, maybe you only want the tense takes, not the relaxed ones, there will be an emotion slider that narrows down results.

## The Technology

TakeOne will be built using OpenAI's APIs for visual understanding and speech transcription, with a vector database for fast similarity search. All heavy processing will happen in the cloud, so users won't need powerful hardware to run the tool.

## Why It Matters

The goal isn't just to build a cool demo. This is a real problem that real editors deal with every day.

Studios and production houses spend significant money on post-production, and a lot of that time goes into tasks that should be faster. Finding footage is one of the biggest time sinks in the editing room. If you can cut that time in half, or more, you're saving real hours and real money.

But more than that, you're letting editors do what they're actually good at. Nobody got into editing because they love scrubbing timelines. They got into it to tell stories. TakeOne aims to get the grunt work out of the way so they can focus on the creative decisions.

## What's Next

After the hackathon, TakeOne could grow in several directions.

Integration with editing software like Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve would let editors search and import clips directly into their timeline. Cloud support would enable teams to share indexed footage across different locations. More advanced features like automatic rough-cut generation based on a script could take things further.

By the end of the hackathon, TakeOne will solve a clear problem in a usable way. That's what we're here to demonstrate.

## Conclusion

TakeOne is about making video search work the way editors actually think. Instead of keywords and filenames, you will describe what you're looking for in plain language, and the system will find it. It will be faster, more intuitive, and will let creative professionals spend their time on creative work.

That's the pitch. We're building something useful, and we're excited to show what it can do.
